# Port-classified CAIDA 2016 dataset

The CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2016 Dataset, aggregated by port and protocol, then matched with IANA port registration data and NMap's well-known service port numbers. This essentially the output of a port and protocol based network traffic classifier.

I am not a lawyer; You will have to judge for yourself what the resulting license is when someone takes three datasets (one of which lacks a formal license), combines them, and reserves no further rights. See you at the supreme court?
